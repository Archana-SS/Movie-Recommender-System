ðŸŽ¬ A content-based Movie Recommendation System: The app allows users to select a movie they like, and based on that selection, it generates recommendations of movies the user might enjoy. These recommendations are based on the genre and content of the selected movie.
------------------

ðŸŽ¥ The system will pull movie plots and poster images to help users decide what to watch next. The project involves building the recommendation system using cosine similarity to measure movie similarity within the dataset. Additionally, a user-friendly interface will be created using Streamlit for interactive movie browsing.

âœ¨ Key Insights and Concepts:
-----------

* Content-Based Filtering : Recommends items based on similarity of item attributes (genres, keywords, overviews) rather than user preferences.
* TF-IDF Vectorization : Converts text data into numerical vectors, emphasizing important words specific to each movie.
* Cosine Similarity : Measures similarity between vectorized movies; values closer to 1 indicate higher similarity.
* Stop Words Removal : Common words that donâ€™t add meaning are filtered out to improve recommendation quality.
* OMDb API Integration : Provides external movie data (plots, posters) to enrich recommendations with details beyond the dataset.
* Streamlit UI : Provides an interactive frontend for users to select movies and view recommendations with enhanced visuals.
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing : Includes handling missing values, concatenating relevant columns, and cleaning text data to prepare for vectorization.
